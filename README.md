# Desafio Murano Group: Quest√£o 1
C++ implementation of Dijkstra's minimum path algorithm and Prim minimum spannning tree algorithm on graphs.
Development environment: Visual Studio Code

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++14 (or newer) compiler

### Installation

- Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ebert-hvm/Murano-Questao-6.git
```
- Compile "main.cpp":
```
g++ -std=c++14 graph.cpp main.cpp -o main
```

## Usage

- Run the C++ program:
```
./main
```
This will create the "result.txt" file in the same directory of main executable, and will also create a txt file with the generated MST for each graph
